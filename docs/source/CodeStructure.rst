Functionality of the project code
=================================

In this section, we will go into detail about what different parts of the project's code do and how they work together to create the overall functionality of the project.

In the following subsections, we will first explain the files that are used on a project-wide level. Then, we will elaborate on the apps of the project which create different parts of the questionnaire, both in terms of their front-end appearance and their back-end data handling.

In the process, we will briefly explain some basic elements of oTree that are necessary to understand the code that is customized for the project. We will also provide some examples of the code that is used in the project to illustrate this functionality in practice.
